# Olist case

**Please note: ** that This is just a quick look of me into datasets. Maybe, I will do more later.


## Some first surprises when EDA datasets

- As I know from previous notebooks and dataset descriptions. Olist is just a ecommerce solution, they just provide solutions for many sellers and buyers to gain the surplus.

- I am from VietNam, which has many active and competitive marketplace platforms. From my vision in VietNam ecommerce. In basic, The market is divided into 2 main types:

1. VietNam start-up companies that operate based on the funding by themselves
( You can search **Tiki** and **Sendo** to know more their strategies and special operations)

2. Foreign companies that operate based on the funding from their ``mother`` company
( You can search **Shopee** and **Lazada** to know more their strategies and special operations)

It  is probably not relevant to Olist, but I just want to provide you some other ways that how ecommerce are manipulated strategy to find a new way to survive.

In last year, many ecommerce companies have given up and filed a bankrupcy because of hot competitive marketplace. ** Ecommerce is burning money **

**Tiki** is a very special ecommerce in VietNam that has a 2h last mile delivery for Tikinow (Tiki has hired some people from Amazon and Facebook). Customers segment of Tiki is mainly located in City.
To be honest, I wish I could work in Tiki environment because of their very special strategy and vision. 

**Sendo** is known as VietNam start-up (like as Tiki). They focus on customers located in countryside and then widen to city

In recently, There is some information that Tiki and Sendo are prepared to merge. 

**Lazada ans Shopee**: Lazada is from giant Alibaba in China
and Shopee is from giant SEA located in Singapore. They also burn many and many money to gain the marketshare.

Top 1 of the number of suffering is Shopee
Top 2 of the number of suffering is Lazada
Top 3 of the number of suffering is Tiki
Top 4 of the number of suffering is Sendo

## Olist model


Unlikely VietNam companies, Olist operates very differently. They just provide solution and platform for their customers (sellers and buyers). I am surprised that the leadtime for shipping product is mainly 12 days. Moreover there is some cases that are 42 days.

               - There is no stock, warehouse
               - There is no shipping product
               - Don't buy products 
               
To know more Olist. I suggest that you should click on [Another_notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/anshumoudgil/olist-ecommerce-analytics-quasi-poisson-poly-regs/code). The author mention very well how Olist oprate it model. On the other hand, I learn from this notebook very much.

# Preparation: Libraries and Datasets


Here are some techniques that I use to standardize datasets for convenient purposes. Likewise, packages are used up to help me to intepret datasets.


- *Leaflet* package is very powerful for visualizing aspect.
- *zoo* package is loaded in order to convert date into **%B %Y** format.
- *tidyverse* package is a very large combined parts. It also has a host website to publish guides
- *scales* package is loaded in order to load `str_to_title() function` to convert string into right format 
- *plotly* package is a package that help me to make interactive graph
- *gridExtra* package is loaded to make many graphs into 1 frame graph
- *crosstalk* package is used for interact with html format
- *kableExtra* package is used for making stylish format
- *DT* package  can't be valid in Kaggle platform. Otherwise, R studio IDE well load it.
- *lubridate* package used to recognize and convert character into date format
- *RColorBrewer* package used to take the beautiful Colors 
- *patchwork* package is like as `gridExtra`, but it is very convenient for manipulating

# It's time to have a first look at Olist datasets {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

- Here are somethings that I have a first look at Olist datasets

## Customer

I don't know why they just store in prefix-zip-code in datasets. Because This is not enough elements to determine each geolocation for each customers. To visualize geolocation, I just calculate the mean of longitude and latitude to have a general view.

               - customer_id
               - customer_unique_id
               - customer_zip_code_prefix
               - customer_city
               - customer_state
               
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

customers%>%head(10)%>%kable()%>%kable_styling()

```


## Geolocation

There are some typo in processing text, but it's more popular in less frequent geolocation_city

               - geolocation_zip_code_prefix
               - geolocation_lat
               - geolocation_lng
               - geolocation_city
               - geolocation_state
               
               
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE,echo=FALSE }

geolocation%>%head(10)%>%kable()%>%kable_styling()

```

## Order

There are some typo in processing text, but it's more popular in less frequent geolocation_city

               - order_id
               - customer_id
               - order_status
               - order_purchase_timestamp
               - order_approved_at
               - order_delivered_carrier_date
               - order_delivered_customer_date
               - order_estimated_delivery_date
               
               
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

orders%>%head(10)%>%kable()%>%kable_styling()

```


## Item

I don't understand Is order_item_id like as order quantity?


               - order_id
               - order_item_id
               - product_id
               - seller_id
               - shipping_limit_date
               - price
               - freight_value
               
               
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

items%>%head(10)%>%kable()%>%kable_styling()

```


## Payment

I don't understand `payment_sequential like as payment quantity?`


               - order_id
               - payment_sequential
               - payment_type
               - payment_installments
               - payment_value
               
               
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

payments%>%head(10)%>%kable()%>%kable_styling()

```


## Review

I don't know Portugese, so the review comment is quite difficult for me to understand. But my first think approach is use sentiment


               - review_id
               - order_id
               - review_score
               - review_comment_title
               - review_comment_message
               - review_creation_date
               - review_answer_timestamp
               
               
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

reviews%>%head(10)%>%kable()%>%kable_styling()

```


## Seller

               - seller_city
               - seller_id
               - seller_zip_code_prefix
               - seller_state
               
               
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

sellers%>%head(10)%>%kable()%>%kable_styling()

```

## Product

               - product_category_name
               - weight
               - quantity
               - height
               - widths
               
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

products%>%head(10)%>%kable()%>%kable_styling()

```

## Product_Category_Name


               - product_category_name
               - product_category_name_english
               
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE }


product_category_name%>%head(10)%>%kable()%>%kable_styling()

```
